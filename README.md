# BigData-NoSQLassignment01
For this assignment, I will be using a dataset that compiles information about NYC yellow taxi cab trips. I will implement some functionalities and answer some questions using findings of queries I should create on my own. 
I can perform any necessary alterations to the data that may improve the usability of these queries or even make them possible. I should implement the task
twice: once per NoSQL database (MongoDB and Cassandra).
